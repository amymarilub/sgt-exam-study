                content: `This procedure establishes a process to provide for the non-criminal investigation and discipline, when necessary, of sworn members for alleged or suspected violations of department rules, regulations, policies, or procedures, which may regulate the conduct of sworn members.

When a complaint focuses on a civilian member, the non-criminal investigation and discipline, when necessary, is determined by the civilian member's Division Commander or in accordance with any applicable administrative directives of the City.

This procedure does not supersede any criminal investigation for alleged violations of criminal laws or statutes by members of this Department.`

                content: `The Department is accountable for all official acts of its employees. Therefore, the Department holds its members to a high standard of conduct and discipline in order to preserve an essential relationship of trust and confidence with the community they serve.

Furthermore, the Department adheres to and practices progressive discipline. This allows for a range of sanctions that take into account the circumstances of individual matters while ensuring that discipline and other behavior modification schemes are commensurate with continued misconduct.

To achieve the desired degree of effectiveness, disciplinary procedures address considerations and expectations from the following three perspectives:

Community or external concerns: An open and positive relationship with the citizens of this community must be preserved. Consequently, the Department accepts all complaints, regardless of form, source, or substance, and initiates investigative action appropriate to the seriousness of the complaint.

Departmental or internal concerns: A consistent and fair disciplinary system supports an effective operational environment. The Department provides corrective action for a member who demonstrates a need for behavioral correction and commends proper conduct and judgment.

Employee concerns: Members should have a reasonable expectation they may exercise prudent judgment in a fair, lawful, and impartial manner while in the proper discharge of their duties and an expeditious and equitable process of disciplinary review will evaluate their actions.

The Internal Affairs Unit shall coordinate all investigations of alleged non-criminal misconduct by sworn members of the Department in accordance with this procedure.

The Chief of Police shall determine which unit or Department member shall investigate allegations of criminal misconduct made against a member of the Department.`

                title: ".03 INCIDENTS INVOLVING OFFICERS",
                content: `Officers will immediately self-report to their immediate supervisor, verbally and in writing on SAPD Form 200-OR, any disturbances that they are involved in that require a law enforcement response or have knowledge or become aware that their involvement in a disturbance has the potential to result in a law enforcement response or a complaint. If the officer's immediate supervisor is not available, the officer shall report his involvement in the disturbance, verbally and in writing to any on-duty supervisor. Any supervisor who received a self-report from an officer shall, submit a report and route his report along with the officer's report utilizing Blue Team, through their chain of command to Internal Affairs for an administrative review, by the end of tour of duty upon receiving the report.

On-duty officers handling any disturbance involving another officer (including from other departments) shall immediately notify their supervisor (handling officer's supervisor) prior to departing the location. A supervisor being notified of a disturbance involving an officer from this department shall make the scene. Upon completing their report, the handling officer shall forward a copy of their report to that same supervisor, who will then route the report in accordance with Section .03(A).

When handling a call for service or interacting with a member of the public and a member of that public, including but not limited to a complainant, witness, suspect, reporting person, etc., requests to speak to a supervisor, officers shall immediately contact and inform an on-duty supervisor of such request through the dispatcher. The supervisor may initially communicate with the requesting person over the telephone to determine whether the supervisor's presence is needed. The supervisor will record his/her actions in a written report. Incidents resulting in a complaint (line or formal) will be handled in accordance with this procedure.`

                id: "line",
                title: ".04 LINE COMPLAINTS",
                content: `Line complaints generally constitute disciplinary matters limited to and involving a minor variance from the routine activities and responsibilities of the sworn member in question.

The sworn member's immediate supervisor initially addresses line complaints, generally resulting in complainant satisfaction from the supervisor's initial contact. The complainant should always be reminded that they may also contact the Internal Affairs Unit if they are not satisfied with the immediate supervisor's response. When appropriate, the Section Commander, with concurrence from the Division Commander, addresses the sworn member's behavior with counseling, a written reprimand, or a suspension of up to five calendar days. (Anything less than a one (1) day suspension is not considered discipline.)

All line complaints shall be investigated by the officer's chain of command within twenty-one (21) calendar days from the date of the written complaint.

The investigation shall be confined strictly to the complaints detailed in the complaint investigation packet.

If the member does not agree with the contemplated disciplinary action within five (5) calendar days, the case will be forwarded to the Internal Affairs Unit for investigation.

Complaints investigated through the chain of command do not entitle the officer to have an attorney present during interviews with their commanding officer.

During the five (5) calendar days' time period nothing prohibits an officer from seeking advice from an attorney or an Association representative.

If the sworn member is the rank of Captain or above, or has no Captain in their chain of command, the officer's Division Commander, Bureau Commander or the Chief of Police or his designee as appropriate, will investigate the complaint.

All line complaint disposition reports shall be entered into Blue Team and forwarded up the chain of command for review and disposition, in accordance with Section .19(C).`

                id: "formal",
                title: ".05 FORMAL COMPLAINTS",
                content: `Formal complaints generally constitute matters involving conduct that exhibits a significant variance from behavioral expectations or practices established through formal training, departmental rules, regulations, policies, or procedures which regulate a sworn member's conduct.

Formal complaints include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. Activities that deal with significant behavioral infractions;
2. Any conduct that if proven would constitute a crime;
3. Any conduct that exhibits the potential to require stringent disciplinary action in the form of a suspension that exceeds five (5) calendar days;
4. Any allegation of harassment/discrimination;
5. Any allegation of racial profiling;
6. Any allegation of unnecessary or excessive force; or
7. Any other incident that may require formal disciplinary proceedings in order to be properly resolved.

Sworn members who receive written complaint notification of a formal complaint from the Internal Affairs Unit may request the complaint be submitted to the expedited disciplinary track method.

The request must be made in writing to the Office of Chief with a copy of the formal complaint notification attached.

Both the sworn member and the Chief must agree to submit the matter to the expedited disciplinary track for an expedited disciplinary finding.

Any disciplinary action must be agreed upon by the sworn member and the Chief, and must be enacted within thirty (30) calendar days of the agreement.

A suspension agreed to by a member may not be appealed or altered by the Civil Service Commission, an arbitrator, or any court.

In no event can the expedited disciplinary track be requested within sixty (60) calendar days of the expiration of the complaint's one-hundred and eighty (180) calendar day timeline in Chapter 143 of the Local Government Code.

The San Antonio Police Department's Complaint Matrix shall be used as a guide when addressing disciplinary action.

All formal preliminary investigations shall be entered into Blue Team and forwarded through the officer's chain of command to Internal Affairs for review and disposition as soon as possible but no later than 15 days after complaint is received.`

                title: ".17 CRASH EVALUATION AND REVIEW BOARD",
                content: `The Crash Evaluation and Review Board (CERB) is designed to review all cases involving city (police) motor vehicle crashes involving sworn members.

4. The crash resulted in bodily injury to any person(s). (1 point)
5. If unsafe speed and/or operation is determined to be a contributing factors. (minimum 1 point)
6. If a Chargeable crash results in a death, no point value is assessed. The Chief of Police administers discipline he deems appropriate.
